## Git vs. GitHub
### Git
* A text-based program.
* Able to control, move, and create repositories.
* A version control system that keeps snapshots of code.
* Does not rely on Github


### GitHub
* Connected to cloud9.
* A more graphic way to organize the information in a file.
* Relies on Git, to add information to the files created. 
* A platform that holds all the files.
* Tracks changes made to the file.

## Initial Setup
1. First create an github account.
    * Go to github.com, create a password and username.
2. Create an cloud9 account
    * Go to c9.io, create a password and username.
3. Then open both accounts and go to your GitHub account and create an SSH key.
